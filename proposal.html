        <p>
            The overview of our proposal highlights around the idea of student debt and finding resources in order to help with this debt. The reason for this is that we want to help students be able to get aid in covering financial obstacles they experience. The idea of student debt is seen as money owed on a student that they loan from the school that they go to in order to manage and pay for their educational expenses. This is a problem particularly for students as they are not able to cover for the initial cost, and the loans continue to rise. In the long run, this can impact students as they have to put off many life milestones to pay off this debt, ranging from buying their first car to buying their first house. With the recent rapid increase in student tuition, it has made student debt the only method to student to pay it off. Overall, with knowing the impacts of student debt, our proposal is intended to consider a specific student's tuition and find the resources they may need in order to pay off the tuition they cannot cover, leading to students not dealing with the obstacles that student debt provides in the future.

        <p>
            When considering the ideas of student debt and resources, the aspects of information technology that is unaddressed is the variety of resources that students are able to receive in order to help with their debt. Students hear about resources such as scholarships from teachers, counselors, and sometimes with the use of internet. However, they only are able to receive a small portion of financial aid that is provided to them. But, within considering information technology, loads of data are received and stored in regard to resources of financial aid. The ability to find the scholarships provided is not addressed in information technology, so our proposal is to help students be given all the financial opportunities they may need and that they have not learned about yet. Our proposal allows them to experience the impact of information technology and be able to analyze all the scholarships resources that will be able to help them within the specific financial situation that they are in.

        <h1>App Description</h1>

        <p>
            The main userbase for our application are university students looking for financial aid options. Students who want to plan their financial aid would come to our site in order to create said plans as well as varying scholarship options to help them plan out their college finances. Additionally, they can view other other's plans as a starting point for inspiration.
        </p>

        <p>
            As this website is a information-providing wesbite, the user will mainly be viewing text-based data. Regarding the results, they will be displayed as blocks of text that includes the name, description, provider, amount, etc. These cards can re-direct the user to the external websites. After creating the cards, the user can input data regarding the financial aid options like what the scholarship requires.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our proposal intends on helping the users plan financial needs. The users will provide the information for their plan of much it will cost for one year of college. After creating their plan they create various financial aid and scholarships cards they are applying to. Based on their cost and total amount of potential aid they will recieve the website will keep of track of their total aid.
            <p>
                The user can create a plan which would consist of a collection of various cards for financial aid options, such as scholarships or loans. Users can subsequently share their plans to serve as a template and place to start for other students who wish to look at financial aid options. Users can look through various templates or create their own. For users looking for templates, they can filter different plans based on which college the student is going to, or how much potential financial aid they need. Plans can keep track of the money that needs to be raise, and how close users are to accumulating that amount. Furthermore, the user page itself can contain useful statistics, such as how many scholarships or financial aid plans one has applied to, how many they've been accepted to, and potentially general financial info, such as how much money they need for their entire college experience as well as how much they've raised.
            </p>

            <p>
                A plan is in essence a collection of cards which store information for each specific option, such as the amount it gives, whether or not a user is accepted, whether the option is yearly or quarterly, etc. The plan itself would be a breakdown of one academic year, where a user could enter the amount of tuition needed for one year, and how much of it they can cover. We would then provide a calculation of much of it is covered through these options, as a percentage. Additionally they can keep track of scholarships requirements.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem we aim to tackle is to help students plan out their college finances. Through our website, users are able to input information about any potential financial aid or scholarships to help a student plan their finances. They can create aid plans to help themselves manage their wallet more wisely. Additionally, they can publish their created payment plans to the website for other users to view. As a result, more people can find corresponding payment plans that they need.
