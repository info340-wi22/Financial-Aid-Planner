        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>1</p>
            </li> The overview of our proposal highlights around the idea of student debt and finding resources in order to help with this debt. The reason for this is that
			we want to help students be able to get aid in covering financial obstalces they experience. The idea of student debt is seen as money owed on a student that they 
			they loan from the school that they go to in order to manage and pay for their educational expenses. This is a problem particulary for students as they are not able to cover 
			for the intital cost, and the loans continue to rise. In the long run, this can impact students as they have to put off many life milestones to pay off this debt, ranging from buying 
			their first car to buying their first house. With the recent rapid increase in student tution, it has made student debt the only method to student to pay it off. Overall, with knowing the impacts of student debt, our proposal is intended
			to consider a specific student's tution and find the resoruces they may need in order to pay off the tution they cannot cover, leading to students not dealing with the obtacles that student debt provides in the future.</li>

            </li> When considering the ideas of student debt and resources, the aspects of information technology that is unaddressed is the variety of resources that students are able to recieve in order to help with their debt.
			Students hear about resources such as scholarships from teachers, conselours, and sometimes with the use of internet. However, they only are able to recieve a small portion of financial aid that is provided to them. But, 
			within considering information technology, loads of data are recieved and stored in regards to resources of financial aid. The ability to find the schloarships provided is not addressed in information technology, so 
			our proposal is to help students be given all the financial opportunities they may need and that they have not learned about yet. Our proposal allows them to experience the impact of information technology 
			and be able to analyze all the schlorships resources that will be able to help them within the specific financial situation that they are in.
