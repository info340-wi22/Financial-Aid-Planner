        <h1>Problem/Data Domain</h1>
        <p>
            The overview of our proposal highlights around the idea of student debt and finding resources in order to help with this debt. The reason for this is that we want to help students be able to get aid in covering financial obstalces they experience. The
            idea of student debt is seen as money owed on a student that they they loan from the school that they go to in order to manage and pay for their educational expenses. This is a problem particulary for students as they are not able to cover
            for the intital cost, and the loans continue to rise. In the long run, this can impact students as they have to put off many life milestones to pay off this debt, ranging from buying their first car to buying their first house. With the recent
            rapid increase in student tution, it has made student debt the only method to student to pay it off. Overall, with knowing the impacts of student debt, our proposal is intended to consider a specific student's tution and find the resoruces
            they may need in order to pay off the tution they cannot cover, leading to students not dealing with the obtacles that student debt provides in the future.

            When considering the ideas of student debt and resources, the aspects of information technology that is unaddressed is the variety of resources that students are able to recieve in order to help with their debt. Students hear about resources such as scholarships
            from teachers, conselours, and sometimes with the use of internet. However, they only are able to recieve a small portion of financial aid that is provided to them. But, within considering information technology, loads of data are recieved
            and stored in regards to resources of financial aid. The ability to find the schloarships provided is not addressed in information technology, so our proposal is to help students be given all the financial opportunities they may need and that
            they have not learned about yet. Our proposal allows them to experience the impact of information technology and be able to analyze all the schlorships resources that will be able to help them within the specific financial situation that they
            are in.

        <h1>App Description</h1>

        <p>
            The main userbase for our application are university students looking for financial aid options. Students who wish to compare differing financial aid plans would come to our site in order to view said plans as well as varying scholarship options to help
            them plan out their college finances.
        </p>

        <p>
            As this website is a information-providing wesbite, the user will mainly be viewing text-based data. Regarding the results, they will be displayed as blocks of text that includes the name, description, provider, amount, etc. These blocks of text will
            be clickable that re-direct the user to the external websites
        </p>

        <p>
            The user will be inputting the total cost of attendence, and the amount they can cover. Based on the inputs, the website will find a list of the most approriate results(scholarships and financial-aids providing websites). The user can then navigate to
            the different resources and proceed from there.

            <p>
                The user can create a plan which would consist of a table of varying financial aid options, such as scholarships. Users can subsequently share their plans to serve as a template and place to start for other students who wish to lookat financial aid options.Users can look through various templates, or create their own. With their plan, they can keep track of the money they need to raise, and how close they are to accumulating that amount. Furthermore, the user page itself can contain useful statistics, such as how many scholarships or financial aid plans one has applied to, how many they've been accepted to, and potentially general finacial info, such as how much money they need for their entire college experience as wellas how much they've raised.
            </p>

            <p>
                A plan is in essence a colection of cards which store information for each specific option, such as the amount it gives, wheter or not a user is accepted, wheter the option is scholarly or quarterly, etc. The plan itself would be a breakdown of one academic year, where a user could enter the amount of tuition needed for one year, and how much of it they can cover. We would then provide a calculation of much of it is covered through these options, as a percentage. Furthermore, when creating a plan, a user would include specfic tags such as the university, and if the student is instate, international, or out of state. Then, other users could search for specific tags when finding a plan template.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our problem we aim to tackle is to help students plan out their college finances. Through our application, users are able to input the information about any potential financial aid or scholarships to help a student plan their payments. They can create payment plans
